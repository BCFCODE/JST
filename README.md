## Overview üåü

JST is more than just a code repository‚Äîit's a complete learning ecosystem for JavaScript developers. Whether you're a beginner building foundational skills or an experienced coder diving into DSAA, this project offers practical exercises, modular code, and rigorous testing to reinforce your knowledge.

- **DSAA Focus**: Concentrate on Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming) with real-world JavaScript implementations.
- **Anki Deck**: We share a curated Anki deck with flashcards covering JS concepts, DSAA topics, and code snippets for effective memorization through spaced repetition. Download it [here](https://github.com/BCFCODE/JST/tree/main/Anki) (over 200 cards included!).
- **Extensive Testing**: Over 4,000 Vitest tests for training exercises, ensuring you practice edge cases, debugging, and optimization.

- **Vitest Testing Setup**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate your code and learn TDD (Test-Driven Development).
- **DSAA Exercises**: Hands-on implementations of key algorithms and data structures, with performance analysis and Big O notation explanations.
- **Anki Integration**: Flashcards for quick review of concepts, syntax, and problem-solving patterns.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started üìö

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for dependency management)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BCFCODE/JST
   cd JST
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

### Usage
- Run your JavaScript files or exercises directly with Node.js:
  ```
  node src/your-file.js
  ```
- Explore DSAA examples in the `src/dsaa/` directory and run them similarly.

### Testing with Vitest üß™
Vitest is integrated for fast, reliable testing. Run all tests with:
```
pnpm test
```

For watch mode (auto-rerun on changes):
```
pnpm test --watch
```

Over 4,000 tests cover fundamentals, edge cases, and DSAA scenarios‚Äîperfect for practice!

### Anki Deck üìá
To reinforce learning, download our Anki deck [here](https://github.com/BCFCODE/JST/tree/main/Anki). It includes:
- JS syntax and best practices.
- DSAA concepts with code examples.
- Problem-solving flashcards.

Import the .apkg file into Anki and start reviewing!
